# CanvasScriptCollection
A collection of Canvas Scripts with a GUI
Over the years myself and others have created useful scripts to automate various processes. These scripts are scattered over many repositories 
The goal here is to take those scripts and combine them all into one UI where they can be utilized by our support, and implmentations teams. 

Currently in early stages. 
Hit file and set token to set your rest token. The application will create it with an encyption key. Do not share the key and encrypted file together in public places!
